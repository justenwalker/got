# got

A collection of Go Types and functions that I find myself creating in many projects.

## Packages

- `env` - Utilities for dealing with environment variables
- `ptr` - Creating pointers to literals and vice-versa.
- `fault` - Utilities for dealing with errors. Named so that it doesn't clash with the built-in `errors` package.
- `optional` - Implements an optional value type and some utility methods and functions to support it.
